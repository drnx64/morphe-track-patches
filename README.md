</p>

An automated compatibility, patch discovery, and update monitoring system for Morphe application patches. This repository monitors multiple patch sources and generates a premium static web dashboard showing compatible apps, release channels, and change history.

This repository was inspired by and built upon concepts from the awesome [awesome-for-morphe](https://github.com/nvbangg/awesome-for-morphe) repository by [@nvbangg](https://github.com/nvbangg).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Tracks patch bundle releases published to the `Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundles` registry.
- **External Repo Discovery**: Fetches community-maintained `repos.txt` from `rushiforai/morphe-archive`, compares it against Jman's bundles, and auto-downloads patch bundles from any external GitHub repos not yet tracked.
- **GitLab & GitHub Support**: Seamlessly parses, validates, and links both GitHub and GitLab source repositories.
- **Multi-channel Monitoring**: Supports both `stable` and `dev` release channels.
- **Smart Change Detection**: Deduplicates consecutive scans via hash-based fingerprints, generating clean historical changelogs.
- **App Icons**: Automatically fetches and caches app icons from Google Play Store.
- **Offline-ready Caching**: Service Worker provides stale-while-revalidate caching for data files and cache-first for static assets.
- **Full Changelog History**: Dedicated changelog viewer with daily rollups of added, updated, and removed apps.

- **Dynamic Web Dashboard**: Beautiful, responsive dark-themed dashboard presenting all patch bundles, compatible apps, and change summaries.
- **Add-to-Source Links**: Dynamic generation of one-click action links to load patch sources directly into the Morphe app.

## ⚙️ Flow Logic & Pipeline Architecture

The update pipeline runs periodically (e.g., via GitHub Actions) and follows these steps:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Fetch Registry Tree] -->|fetch_patch_tree.py| B[Tree Output]
    B -->|download_bundles.py| C{Is Morphe Bundle?}
    C -->|No / non-.mpp| D[Skip Bundle]
    C -->|Yes / .mpp| E[Download Bundle & List Json]
    E -->|fetch_external_repos.py| E1{Fetch repos.txt from<br/>morphe-archive}
    E1 --> E2[Parse & compare<br/>against Jman bundles]

```

### 1. File Discovery (`fetch_patch_tree.py`)
Queries the GitHub Git Trees API for `Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundles` recursive tree on the `bundles` branch. It stores the metadata of all discovered files under `patch-bundles/` in `tree.json`.

### 2. Downloader & Filter (`download_bundles.py`)
Iterates over the discovered tree. It parses `patches-bundle.json` files and performs the critical check:
- If a bundle's `download_url` points to a `.mpp` binary (Morphe Patch Package) and matches the correct structure, it proceeds. Otherwise, it is skipped.
- Downloads files into `data/raw/bundles/<bundle_name>/<channel>/` locally.

### 2b. External Repo Discovery (`fetch_external_repos.py`)
A supplementary step that broadens coverage beyond Jman's central registry:

- Fetches `repos.txt` from the community [`rushiforai/morphe-archive`](https://github.com/rushiforai/morphe-archive) — a curated list of all known Morphe patch repositories.
- Scans the already-downloaded `data/raw/bundles/` directory to build a set of repo URLs already present in Jman's bundles.
- Filters out repos that are already tracked, and skips known non-patch repos (e.g., `builder-for-morphe`, `awesome-revanced`).
- For each untracked repo:
  1. Fetches `patches-bundle.json` and `patches-list.json` directly from `raw.githubusercontent.com` (tries `main`, then `master`).
  2. Validates the bundle has a `.mpp` download URL.
  3. Fetches GitHub releases via the API to determine stable vs. dev channel and version tags.
  4. Writes the bundle files into `data/raw/bundles/<slug>/<channel>/` — the exact same directory structure used by Jman bundles.
- Saves/refreshes `data/repos_list.txt` — a local text file listing all known repos with their `owner/repo -> https://github.com/owner/repo` mapping and a sortable list of every tracked repo.

**Key insight:** Once external repos are downloaded, they are treated identically to Jman bundles by every downstream pipeline step (parsing, fingerprinting, diffing, merging, dashboard rendering). The pipeline does not distinguish between a bundle that came from the central registry vs. an external repo.

---

### 3. Parser & Icon Enrichment (`parse_bundles.py` & `icon_fetcher.py`)
Parses downloaded bundles, checks package compatibility lists (`compatiblePackages`), maps package identifiers to user-friendly titles, and extracts the correct repository URLs and usernames by parsing the release's `download_url`. Each app is then enriched with a Google Play Store icon by scraping the `og:image` meta tag; results are cached in `data/state/icon_cache.json` to avoid re-scraping every pipeline run.

### 4. Fingerprint & Diff (`fingerprint_engine.py` & `diff_engine.py`)
Computes SHA-256 hashes of the parsed files. It compares the current scan snapshot with the previous snapshot:
- Detects if any bundle versions have been upgraded/downgraded.
- Detects if any compatible applications have been added, updated, or removed.

### 5. Finalizer (`merge_daily_buffer.py`)
Consolidates changes within a 24-hour window to keep notifications clean. It computes global statistics:
- **Total Bundles**: Counts unique bundles by checking name and repository (stable and dev release channels under the same bundle name and repo count as **1**).
- **Total Apps**: Counts unique app package names across all bundles.
- Saves the database output to `data/core.json`, `data/stats.json`, `data/changes.json`, and `data/bundles.json`.

### 6. Static Site Sync (`generate_site.py`)
Reads files from disk and writes them back to preserve them during CI checkouts. Also copies `changelog.json` to `data/changelog.json` for the web frontend. The actual working static files are maintained directly on disk — this script simply ensures they survive a fresh GitHub Actions checkout.

## 👏 Credits

### Inspiration
- [@nvbangg](https://github.com/nvbangg) — [awesome-for-morphe](https://github.com/nvbangg/awesome-for-morphe) served as the template and inspiration for this dashboard.
- [@rushiforai](https://github.com/rushiforai) — [morphe-archive](https://github.com/rushiforai/morphe-archive) maintains the community `repos.txt` that feeds the external repo discovery.

### Central Registry
- [@Jman-Github](https://github.com/Jman-Github) — [ReVanced-Patch-Bundles](https://github.com/Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundles) is the primary upstream registry.
