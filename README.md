# Morphe Patch Tracker

An automated compatibility, patch discovery, and update monitoring system for Morphe application patches. This repository monitors multiple patch sources and generates a premium static web dashboard showing compatible apps, release channels, and change history.

This repository was inspired by and built upon concepts from the awesome [awesome-for-morphe](https://github.com/nvbangg/awesome-for-morphe) repository by [@nvbangg](https://github.com/nvbangg).

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Tracks patch bundle releases published to the `Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundles` registry.
- **GitLab & GitHub Support**: Seamlessly parses, validates, and links both GitHub and GitLab source repositories.
- **Multi-channel Monitoring**: Supports both `stable` and `dev` release channels.
- **Smart Change Detection**: Deduplicates consecutive scans via hash-based fingerprints, generating clean historical changelogs.
- **Dynamic Web Dashboard**: Beautiful, responsive dark-themed dashboard presenting all patch bundles, compatible apps, and change summaries.
- **Add-to-Source Links**: Dynamic generation of one-click action links to load patch sources directly into the Morphe app.

## ⚙️ Flow Logic & Pipeline Architecture

The update pipeline runs periodically (e.g., via GitHub Actions) and follows these steps:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Fetch Registry Tree] -->|fetch_patch_tree.py| B[Tree Output]
    B -->|download_bundles.py| C{Is Morphe Bundle?}
    C -->|No / non-.mpp| D[Skip Bundle]
    C -->|Yes / .mpp| E[Download Bundle & List Json]
    E -->|parse_bundles.py| F[Extract Repos & Unique Apps]
    F -->|fingerprint_engine.py| G[Generate Hashes]
    G -->|diff_engine.py| H{Has Changes?}
    H -->|No & No Rollover| I[Exit Silently]
    H -->|Yes| J[Update Daily Buffer]
    J -->|merge_daily_buffer.py| K[Update live.json]
    K -->|generate_site.py| L[Generate Web Dashboard]
```

### 1. File Discovery (`fetch_patch_tree.py`)
Queries the GitHub Git Trees API for `Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundles` recursive tree on the `bundles` branch. It stores the metadata of all discovered files under `patch-bundles/` in `tree.json`.

### 2. Downloader & Filter (`download_bundles.py`)
Iterates over the discovered tree. It parses `patches-bundle.json` files and performs the critical check:
- If a bundle's `download_url` points to a `.mpp` binary (Morphe Patch Package) and matches the correct structure, it proceeds. Otherwise, it is skipped.
- Downloads files into `data/raw/bundles/<bundle_name>/<channel>/` locally.

### 3. Parser (`parse_bundles.py`)
Parses downloaded bundles, checks package compatibility lists (`compatiblePackages`), maps package identifiers to user-friendly titles, and extracts the correct repository URLs and usernames by parsing the release's `download_url`.

### 4. Fingerprint & Diff (`fingerprint_engine.py` & `diff_engine.py`)
Computes SHA-256 hashes of the parsed files. It compares the current scan snapshot with the previous snapshot:
- Detects if any bundle versions have been upgraded/downgraded.
- Detects if any compatible applications have been added, updated, or removed.

### 5. Finalizer (`merge_daily_buffer.py`)
Consolidates changes within a 24-hour window to keep notifications clean. It computes global statistics:
- **Total Bundles**: Counts unique bundles by checking name and repository (stable and dev release channels under the same bundle name and repo count as **1**).
- **Total Apps**: Counts unique app package names across all bundles.
- Saves the database output to `data/live.json`.

### 6. Static Site Compiler (`generate_site.py`)
Compiles the final static assets (`index.html`, `changelog.html`, and `assets/app.js` / `assets/style.css`) to reflect the latest scanning results, rendering appropriate GitLab or GitHub repository badges, links, and Add-to-Source buttons.

## 👏 Credits & Inspiration

Special thanks to [@nvbangg](https://github.com/nvbangg) for his work on [awesome-for-morphe](https://github.com/nvbangg/awesome-for-morphe). His repository's clean design, async bundle fetching, and structured JSON parsing served as the template and inspiration for this automated monitoring dashboard.
